ABOUT DIA PORTABLE
===================
The Dia Portable Launcher allows you to run Dia from a removable drive whose 
letter changes as you move it to another computer. The program can be entirely self-
contained on the drive and then used on any Windows computer.


LICENSE
========
This code is released under the GPL. The source is included with this package as 
DiaPortable.nsi.


INSTALLATION / DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
===================================
By default, the program expects the following directory structure:

-\ <--- Directory with DiaPortable.exe
	+\App\
		+\Dia\
	+\Data\
		+\settings\


It can be used in other directory configurations by including the DiaPortable.ini 
file in the same directory as DiaPortable.exe and configuring it as details in the 
INI file section below.


DIAPORTABLE.INI CONFIGURATION
==============================
The Dia Portable Launcher will look for an ini file called DiaPortable.ini 
within its directory (see the Installation/Directory Structure section above for more 
details). If you are happy with the default options, it is not necessary, though. The 
INI file is formatted as follows:

[DiaPortable]
DiaDirectory=App\Dia
GTKDirectory=NONE
SettingsDirectory=Data\settings
DiaExecutable=diaw.exe
AdditionalParameters=
DisableIntegratedUI=false

The DiaDirectory, GTKDirectory and SettingsDirectory entries should be set to the *relative* 
path to the appropriate directories from the current directory. They must be a subdirectory 
(or multiple subdirectories) of the directory containing DiaPortable.exe. The default entries 
for these are described in the installation section above.

The DiaExecutable entry allows you to set the Dia Portable Launcher to use an alternate EXE 
call to launch Dia. This is helpful if you are using a machine that is set to deny diaw.exe 
from running. You'll need to rename the diaw.exe file and then enter the name you gave it on 
the DiaExecutable= line of the INI.

The AdditionalParameters entry allows you to pass additional commandline parameter entries to 
the DiaExecutable. Whatever you enter here will be appended to the call to diaw.exe.

The DisableIntegratedUI entry allows you to disable the integrated UserInterface of Dia Portable. 
The default is false.
